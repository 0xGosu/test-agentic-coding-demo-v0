## üìã Open Questions for Client

Before kicking off, please confirm:

1. **Is the 2-week schema discovery timeline realistic?**
   - Can we get database export/access Day 1?
   - Are there any Supabase access restrictions?

2. **What design references do you have?**
   - Any competitor platforms you like?
   - Specific color palette preferences?

3. **Xero/Airwallex account access:**
   - Who owns these accounts?
   - Can we get API credentials by Week 2?

4. **Airtable data:**
   - Can we audit data quality in advance (Week 8)?
   - Any known data issues?
   - How many records per table?

5. **Beta testing:**
   - Do you have 10-20 users identified?
   - Will they be available Week 11-12?

6. **Payment rates:**
   - Typical trial fee amount?
   - Average package size (hours/price)?

7. **Go-live criteria:**
   - Must all features be 100% or phased launch OK?
   - Acceptable bug severity for launch?

## üìû Contact & Sign-off

**Prepared For:**
- Zach (Project Lead)
- zach@stryvacademics.com
- Levitate Limited (Stryv Academics)

**Estimation Date:** December 2024

**Valid Until:** January 31, 2025

## üìã Key Assumptions

1. **Schema discovery completes in 2 weeks** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Xero/Airwallex sandbox ready by Week 2**
3. **No brand guidelines** (full design system creation)
4. **13-week timeline** with target completion before January 30, 2026
5. **Team starts simultaneously Week 1** (October 27, 2025)
6. **No major scope changes** during development
7. **Holiday weeks** (Dec 25-Jan 1) = reduced capacity but accounted for

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **This is an aggressive timeline.** The 12-week delivery requires:
   - Immediate team availability (all 8.5 FTE)
   - Fast decision-making (max 24hr turnaround)
   - Limited scope changes
   - Strong client partnership

2. **Schema discovery is critical.** If this extends beyond 2 weeks, the entire timeline shifts.

3. **Efficiency assumptions:** We've assumed 85% efficiency due to coordination overhead with a larger team. This is realistic but means there's minimal slack.

4. **Quality vs. Speed tradeoff:** With this accelerated timeline, we're optimizing for feature completeness and stability, but some polish items may be deferred to post-launch.

5. **Recommended contingency:** Consider a 2-week buffer for unforeseen issues (total 14 weeks).
